                The moderate levels of anxiety that you present can interfere with your daily activities, the symptoms
                are often not taken into account by people until they become a major problem.</p>
            <p>
                You need to start thinking about taking action to prevent your situation from worsening later and becoming more
                difficult to control. One of the best options available is to see a doctor to follow the appropriate treatment and
                improve your quality of life. On the other hand, if you think that your symptoms are not so problematic yet, you can try some strategies/methods that can help you feel better.

                People with severe anxiety can have serious problems with their lives as physical symptoms and intrusive thoughts are more intense, persistent and difficult to control.
            </p>
            <p>
                In more extreme cases, individuals cannot leave their homes, which causes serious damage to their emotional health by isolating them from the people around them.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

                <p>
                    While you are (hopefully) waiting to get medical attention you can try to do some things on your own to reduce anxiety, here is a list of the best ones!
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="res_list">
                        <strong class="purple">Exercise.</strong>
                        <br>
                        Exercise is one of the best activities you can do to relax and it's not necessary to spend a lot of time of your day to notice differences, although we know that for some people it's not something pleasant we encourage you to give it a shot.
                        <br>
                        Start with an activity you think you would like and at your own pace.
                    </li>
                    <li class="res_list">
                        <strong class="purple">Sleep.</strong>
                        <br>
                        When not resting appropriately your anxiety levels can get worse, try to sleep at least 7 hours every night.
                    </li>
                    <li class="res_list">
                        <strong class="purple">Know your anxiety</strong>
                        <br>
                        We are all different. Start paying attention and identify what are the things that trigger your anxiety, if you know what triggers it, you can analyze it and develop strategies that help you feel better in those situations.
